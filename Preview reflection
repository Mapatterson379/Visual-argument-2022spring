In my first preview I have gathered all of the photos of Black women who have been killed by police. There is a layer mask over their images and a layer of large font that reads "SAY HER NAME" on top of that. At this point I am showing the many faces of those affected by police brutality. Behind these 
images are stories. Some stories intertwin because of their endings and some are specific to each life those depicted have lived. For every Black woman here there is someone connected to them that has also been affected. The women included, from left to right, are Korryn Gaines, Alteria Woods, Atatiana Jefferson, Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Tanisha Anderson, Aura Rosser, followed by India Kager (below), Tanisha Fonville, and Decynthia Clements (bottom right). 
"SAY HER NAME" tries to uplift these victims by bringing attention to their names-- their stories. Originally, I intended to make a collage of these women's faces into a silhouette of a face. However, in the process of doing this I found that it was hard to recognize each individual face. Being that my message is about the importantance of knowing these victims names, or stories, I thought that it would not be as helpful if the audience could not see their faces or recognize each individual. For me, giving each picture its own space had more of an impact. There are still a few additional edits I would like to make to my visual arugment. As of right now I want to cut out the space within the words "SAY HER NAME" and have the pictures underneath be visible through the cut out. My goal with this is to highlight the women who make up the phrase and more importantly, who it is meant to uplift and honor.
